Two sprite animation players will be on top of each other.
- Top one will be lineart
- Bottom one will be color

This is so you can edit the color sprite in engine without
affecting the rest of the sprite.

Each variation of the penguin and their hats are labelled
accordingly with uppercase

In Unity, make sure to set the texture type to "Sprite 2d"
so it doesn't interact with global illumination and other
effects.
